        <h4>Phoenix</h4>
      </section>
      <section class="grid-item summary">
        <p class="summary-text">
          A duelist by role and nature, Phoenix is brash, impulsive, and has a
          lot of confidence, never hesitating to charge into a fight head-on
          despite not getting a full grasp of the situation, much to the chagrin
          of his more collected teammates. As shown in "RETAKE," if Phoenix gets
          himself in a sticky situation caused by his own impatience, he is more
          than capable of quickly adapting to the circumstances and turning the
          tables around, before rubbing it in the faces of teammates who
          initially doubted him. Despite Phoenix's hasty ways, he is known as a
          prodigy (claiming that it wasn't his own words), and he always proves
          it one way or another!

        <h4>Sage</h4>
      </section>
      <section class="grid-item summary">
        <p class="summary-text">
          Described as a stronghold, Sage is an agent who always looks out for
          her teammates and offers help whenever she can. She has fully embraced
          her powers which give her control of life, and wishes to use them to
          keep her team alive for as long as possible. Calmer and more collected
          than some of her more energetic allies, Sage always imparts
          encouraging words to rally the team up and guide them to victory!

        <h4>Chamber</h4>
      </section>
      <section class="grid-item summary">
        <p class="summary-text">
          With a blend of suave nonchalance, professional poise, and smug
          comedy, Chamber is fully confident with the skill he provides and the
          value that he offers. He sets high standards for himself and his team,
          reminding everyone that if they were to secure victories, they might
          as well go all-out and be the best in what they do. He has shown
          friendliness with many of the agents in the Protocol, but he is very
          much aware that he holds many secrets which are better kept hidden.

        <h2>Ankit Raj</h2>
        <h4>Sova</h4>
      </section>
      <section class="grid-item summary">
        <p class="summary-text">
          A humble hunter that has taken down man and beast alike, Sova works
          carefully and with precision, scouting around and retrieving
          information before taking out the enemy. As he has told Phoenix, Sova
          believes in the value of patience and strategic thinking. Being the
          team player that he is, Sova always commends his allies and never
          hesitates to voice out his vote of confidence in them. He seems to
          value the team to the point of risking his own life, to which
          Brimstone reminds him that it is equally important that he looks out
          after himself.
